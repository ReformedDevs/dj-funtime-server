## Contributing
We're following the "Read-only Master Branch" philosophy. Therefore, in order to make changes, please fork the project and create a new branch for the issue you'd like to tackle then make a pull request to get it reviewed when you're ready.

**please use the following format for naming your branch:**
```
<username or initials>-issue-23
```

In order to make things easier for everyone, try to keep the following things in mind:
- Keep commits cohesive
- Keep commits as small as possible
- Commits should contains no more than one logical change. If it contains more, the commit should be split.

**Please write good commit messages!**

A good commit message answers three questions:
- Why is this change necessary?
- How does it address the issue?
- What effects does the patch have?
